# matlab-chemists-tutorial
This respository houses example code for a Matlab tutorial in development at the University of South Carolina based on work by Andrew Greytak and Morgan Stefik.

The code has been primarily tested with Matlab version R2022b. Some scripts and functions are intentionally incomplete as an exercise for the student. Others are incomplete because we haven't built them out yet. While you can clone this repository, you may wish to simply make a non-versioned copy of the files, since it is expected that you will modify many of them as a part of the tutorial and will not necessarily want to commit those changes to your clone.
