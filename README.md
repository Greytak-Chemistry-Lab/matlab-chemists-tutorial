# matlab-chemists-tutorial
This respository houses example code for a Matlab tutorial in development at the University of South Carolina based on work by Andrew Greytak and Morgan Stefik.

The code has been primarily tested with Matlab version R2022b.

There are presently 6 tutorial units. The "tutorial" .m file(s) in each unit are intended as a hands-on introduction to key commands and concepts. Exercises have code that is intentionally either incomplete or absent so you can try coming up with something that works. Some examples have accompanying "solved" versions. Demos are functioning examples that are meant to be interesting and may go into much more detail, more advanced Matlab tools, or specialized chemistry and physics topics.

The Presentation folder contains a slide show with an overview of units 1, 2, 3, and 6. 

This tutorial is a work in progress: some parts may be incomplete. While you can clone this repository, you may wish to simply download a non-versioned of the files, since it is expected that you will modify many of them as a part of the tutorial, and you will not necessarily want to commit those changes to your clone.
